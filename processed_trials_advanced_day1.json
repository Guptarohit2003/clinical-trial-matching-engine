Suspected or latent tuberculosis (confirmed by positive interferon-\u03b3 release assay)\n28. Known or suspected chronic active Epstein-Barr viral infection or evidence of positive HTLV1 serology.\n29. Any life-threatening illness, medical condition, or organ system dysfunction which, in the investigator opinion, could compromise the subject's safety, interfere with the absorption or metabolism of study treatments, or put the study outcomes at undue risk.\n30.

Subjects with a history of autoimmune-related hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid-replacement hormone may be eligible.\n    2. Subjects with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus who are on an insulin regimen are eligible for the study.\n    3. Subjects with a history of autoimmune hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, vascular thrombosis associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, multiple sclerosis, or glomerulonephritis will be excluded.\n    4. Subjects with a history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myasthenia gravis, myositis rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, or other autoimmune diseases will be excluded unless they have not required systemic therapy in the last 12 months.\n32. Subject with history of confirmed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n33. Active malignancy other than the one treated in this research. Prior history of malignancies unless the subject has been free of the disease for \u2265 2 years. However, subjects with the following history/concurrent conditions are allowed:\n\n    1. Basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n    2. Carcinoma in situ of the cervix\n    3. Carcinoma in situ of the breast\n    4. Incidental histologic finding of prostate cancer (T1a or T1b) using the tumor, nodes, metastasis \\[TNM\\] clinical staging system.\n34. Pregnant, planning to become pregnant or lactating WOCBP.\n35. Any significant medical conditions, laboratory abnormality or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation or understanding of study requirements (according to the investigator's decision).\n36. Severe or debilitating pulmonary disease, history of interstitial lung disease, noninfectious pneumonitis, or uncontrolled lung diseases, including but not limited to pulmonary fibrosis and acute lung diseases.\n37. Known or suspected history of HLH unless related to lymphoma.\n38. Clinically significant history of cirrhotic liver disease, ongoing, drug-induced liver injury, alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, ongoing extrahepatic obstruction caused by cholelithiasis, cirrhosis of the liver, or portal hypertension.\n39. INR or PT \\> 1.5 x ULN, or Quick percentage \\< 70% (if Quick percentage used in lieu of time-based units for reporting PT), in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation.\n40. aPTT \\>1.5 x ULN in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation or a lupus anticoagulant.\n41. Prior solid organ transplantation.\n42. Person deprived of his/her liberty by a judicial or administrative decision.\n43. Person hospitalized without consent.\n44. Adult person under legal protection.\n\nNB: for 42, 43, 44 if there is an individual benefit for such subjects, an Ethics Committee will have to be informed case by case.\n\n\\-"

Contraception will start during therapy including dose interruptions, for 4 months after discontinuation of Ixazomib and Daratumumab.\n\nCriteria for women of childbearing potential:\n\nThis protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who:\n\n1. has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or\n2. has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)\n\n   * A woman of childbearing potential must have 2 negative serum or urine pregnancy tests at Screening, first within 28 days prior to dosing and the second within 48 hours prior to dosing, and remain on a highly effective method of birth control. The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:\n\n     * Highly effective methods: Intrauterine device (IUD) ; Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants) ; Tubal ligation ; Partner's vasectomy\n     * Additional effective methods: Male condom ; Diaphragm CervicalCap\n   * Serum (urine in the case where serum is not possible in a timely manner) pregnancy test to be performed for all women of childbearing potential regularly during the study, In addition, a pregnancy test may be done at any time during the study at the discretion of the investigator if a subject misses a period or has unusual menstrual bleeding.\n   * A woman of childbearing potential must remain on a highly effective method of birth control. Contraception must begin 4 weeks before initiating treatment with Ixazomib and Daratumumab, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 months following discontinuation of Ixazomib and Daratumumab. Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy.\n   * A man who has not had a vasectomy and who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must agree to use a barrier method of birth control eg, condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository, and all men must also not donate sperm during the study, for 4 months following discontinuation of Ixazomib and Daratumumab. The exception to this restriction is that if the subject's female partner is surgically sterile, a second method of birth control is not required."

Note: that HIV positive patients will be eligible.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the teratogenic risks of radiation exposure to the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with radiation therapy and supportive care medications required for symptomatic management of head and neck cancer side effects as well as general anesthesia required for oncologic head and neck surgery, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled in the study.
